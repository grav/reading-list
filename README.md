# reading-list

Export Safari's reading list as html.

Nice if you want to access your reading list from a non-Apple device, eg. a Kindle.

## Usage

The tool takes a plist in XML format from standard in, and outputs an html file on standard out,
so you need to convert the plist file from binary with Apple's `plutil`:

```
$ plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | lein run > reading-list.html
```

The above one-liner will do the conversion, create the reading list as a web page, and output it to an html file.

This will generate an html file with links to all reading list entries.

I did have problems with the XML output at some point, so I used `xmllint` to recover only valid xml:

```
$ plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | xmllint --recover - 2> /dev/null | lein run > reading-list.html
```

Uses [clj-plist](https://github.com/bdesham/clj-plist) for parsing the plist file.
